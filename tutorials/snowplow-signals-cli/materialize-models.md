title: Materializing Models to Feature Store
---

> ⚠️ This feature is currently under development and will be available in a future release.

## Coming Soon

The materialization feature will allow you to create batch sources in your feature store from your Snowplow Signals models. This will enable:

- Creating batch sources from your dbt models
- Configuring feature store ingestion schedules
- Managing feature store metadata
- Setting up feature store monitoring

This feature will bridge the gap between your dbt models and the feature store, making it easier to serve your features in production.

Stay tuned for updates on this feature!
